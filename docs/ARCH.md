# Dump Tree Format v3

Version 3 of the `dump-tree` command writes a Markdown file named `tree.md`.
The output shows the directory hierarchy wrapped in a fenced code block.

Example usage:

```bash
modcompose dump-tree ./my_project --version 3
```

Sample output begins with the header:

```markdown
# Project Tree v3
```
```text
my_project/
├── configs/
│   └── section.yaml
└── outputs/
    └── demo.mid
```
